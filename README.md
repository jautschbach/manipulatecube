# manipulatecube

A Fortran tool used by me and my group to work with volume data files in the 
'cube' format

See https://github.com/jautschbach/mathematica-notebooks for some Mathematica
notebooks to visualize this kind of volume data

Note: The sorting routine used in the code comes from lapack, so you need to 
have lapack libraries installed. Needed at compile time.
