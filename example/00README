run 

../manipulatecube.exe density.cube fac 1.0

to see a list of isovalues and corresponding density integration threshold.
For example, the 80% integrated density isosurface value for density.cube
is 0.002314.

density.cube is the square of the ethene pi MO, generated with the 
'mul' command of manipulatecube as follows:

../manipulatecube.exe ethene-pi.cube mul ethene-pi.cube

If you visualize isosurfaces for ethene-pi.cube at 
+/-0.0481 = +/-sqrt(0.002314), the resulting isosurfaces contain 80% of the
orbital's probability.
